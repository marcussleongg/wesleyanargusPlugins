# wesleyanargusPlugins

Plugins for The Wesleyan Argus Wordpress site

Custom plugins and shortcodes because it was easier for implementation.

Go to wp-content/plugins and create a folder for the plugins. For shortcodes, go to wp-content/themes/{theme_used} and paste the code at the bottom of functions.php
